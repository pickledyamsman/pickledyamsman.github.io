<p>I am currently still working on getting a full time development job, but I think I have a bit of wisdom from what I have been doing that seems to be working well. I have been going to various meet-ups and these are the things that have gotten positive feedback, and I am sure will help me get a job soon.</p>

<h4>Firstly, I go to every meet up that my city has.</h4>
<p>This might be prohibitive in larger cities where there could be more than ten a week, but definitely the more the better. I have two meet-ups that happen every week, one the last Thursday of every month, and one the first Thursday of every month. That's ten meet-ups a month and I would do more if they were available to me. This has helped get people to know me and what I do. The first time I meet someone new I tell them about myself and what I have been working on recently. This is like the elevator pitch, and I usually get something similar back from the person I am talking to. At this point, I have quite a few people that know me by name and come up to talk to me at meet-ups when I get there. Definite progress.</p>

<h4>Secondly, what I wear. There are two types of meet-ups that I go to.</h4>
<p>Casual meet-ups for drinks or food and more professional meet-ups that deal with new projects or jobs in my area. It might sound obvious, but you should wear a professional outfit for a professional meet-up and a casual outfit for a casual meet-up. It's as simple as that. The tricky part is the first meeting. I wasn't sure what some of these meet-ups were going to be like so I just wore a polo and jeans to each one. This was professional enough that I wouldn't seem like a slob at a professional meet-up and casual enough for the casual meet-ups, a win-win scenario! After the first meet-up I switched up what I wore to match the meet-up.</p>

<h4>Thirdly, talk to everyone.</h4>
<p>This is linked to the first step but different enough that I thought I would separate them. I try to make as many connections as possible while I am at a meet-up. It is easy to find one or two people you like and just stick with them, but that's not helping you in your job search unless they are hiring and want you to interview right there. That never happens though. If I spend more than ten minutes with someone I try to set up a meeting with them for coffee or drinks to talk more about whatever it was we were chatting about so I can move on and talk to more people. This is easier when I am in a group than if I am chatting one-on-one with someone, but it is still easy enough.</p>

<h4>Lastly, get involved with the meet-ups.</h4>
<p>This is the hardest thing to do in my opinion, but I feel it gets a lot of results. If you just go to a meet-up, talk to a few people, and leave you are not doing enough. After the meet-up connect with the people you met through LinkedIn or messaging through meetup.com or whatever website you used to meet these people. This makes the connection more solidified and more likely to lead to something concrete. Also, if you think of something that might improve the meet-up go ahead and suggest it. Obviously, don't try to change everything about the meet-up or give a new suggestion every week, but something that might be fun will hardly ever go over poorly.</p>

<p>These are some of the things I have been doing at meet-ups that have worked well. Meet-ups are kind of weird and not something I had ever done before, so it's definitely something I have had to learn to be comfortable doing. With a bit of effort it's something anyone can do!</p>
