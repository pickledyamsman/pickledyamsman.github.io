<h3>Why I switched</h3>
<p>Up until about two weeks ago I exclusively used Sublime Text for my development needs, and I had been fairly happy with it. However, I wanted to try out the Atom editor so I decided to switch over. This turned out to be a good thing anyways because the Learn IDE is based off Atom, and I started working as a Learn Expert and I need to be familiar with Atom to better help students. I don't think it's ever a problem to know too much information so learning what I liked and didn't like about Atom would help me decide if Atom was the editor I wanted to use full-time.</p>

<h3>What I Like about Atom over Sublime Text</h3>
<p>There are a number of things that I think Atom does really well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the interface is really nice. Atom just looks slick and that was my first impression of it and I still hold it. It looks like I am developing when I have Atom open and this is something, though superficial, that I like about Atom.</p>

<p>Secondly, it's free. This isn't that big of a deal but when using Sublime Text I would get multiple pop-ups a day asking me to pay them for a quality product they had made. Honestly, I should pay Sublime Text for their product, but right now I am not at a place to do that so the pop-ups stay. Because of the open-source nature of Atom, they don't ask me for anything. This is a small thing but it definitely is nice to not get interrupted while I am working on something.</p>

<p>Thirdly, file saving works better. In Sublime Text, to save a file I create a blank file, then save it. In Atom this is all wrapped into one task. I save the file when I create it. This cuts seconds off of the time it takes me to create an app. It is a nice feature that I am sure I could get working in Sublime Text, but with Atom it works this way out of the box and that's great.</p>

<p>Lastly, I haven't used it for this yet but apparently deployment with Atom is better than Sublime Text. Everything I have read says that from FTP to anything else deployment specific Atom deals with it better than Sublime Text. Like I said, I haven't used it for this so I can't say much about it aside from the fact that it sounds like it will be nice when I get to use it.</p>

<h3>What I like about Sublime Text over Atom</h3>
<p>Admittedly, I haven't been using Atom for that long so most of the things I don't like about Atom could have a fix I don't know about yet.</p>

<p>Firstly, ease of use. With Sublime Text, I have Emmet installed with all of the preferences I like and I haven't figured out how to configure them properly with Atom. Code completion in Sublime with Emmet is as simple as typing p and hitting enter and it creates a new paragraph. The closest I have come to getting this to work in Atom with Emmet is using Ctrl + E to create the paragraph. This isn't that big of a change, but I constantly hit the wrong key and have to stop and look down at my keyboard to fix my mistake. That is really annoying.</p>

<p>Secondly, working with languages Atom doesn't support out of the box. I have recently started learning Haskell and Atom doesn't seem to like Haskell. I have followed guides to get Atom up and running with Haskell but nothing configures correctly. Sublime Text had it working with one package installed and it works really well. I don't know what other language limitations there might be, but I know I won't be using Atom for Haskell in the future.</p>

<p>Thirdly, speed. With most apps Atom has been fine, but when I load up a big project, like my final assessment that has many long files, Atom lags some while scrolling through the files. This was never a problem with Sublime Text, so I can only assume it is a limitation in Atom. I don't normally deal with giant files so it isn't a huge deal, but when I start working I assume they will have large files and this might present a problem in the future.</p>

<p>Lastly, dealing with packages in general. Sublime Text handles packages really well I feel. I can search for and install whatever package I need in seconds, and I know it will generally work well out of the box. This is great! Getting Emmet working fully was a matter of minutes and the same was true for setting up a Haskell environment. Both of these things are problems I am still having with Atom even after weeks of trying to get them working.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, out of necessity, I am going to have to keep using Atom for Learn related things, but I think for my own projects I will continue to use Sublime Text. It may be that I am just used to the flow of Sublime Text so that is why I like it more. Who knows? I will keep using Atom for work and for projects with Learn and maybe it will grow on me and become my editor of choice, but I really don't think that will be the case.</p>
