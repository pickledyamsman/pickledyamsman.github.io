<h1>The Ruby Gems I Use the Most from Learn</h1>
<h3>Devise</h3>
<p>Hands-down the gem that I use the most is Devise. We had to use it for the learn program and it has been useful ever since. It lets you easily authenticate a user in a number of ways. I used Devise for the last three assessments and it was easy to set up and get working perfectly. You already know about it but Devise is really super useful.</p>

<h3>Pry</h3>
<p>Another gem from the course but another super useful one. Pry is the app that will help you out the most trying to figure out what is wrong with your program. Need to see what you params are? Use Pry. Need to see why you aren't getting the right data somewhere? Use pry and follow the path. Pry is like a magic wand that helps you locate where your program is breaking.</p>

<h3>Active Admin</h3>
<p>Active Admin sets up in minutes and does all the admin stuff you want it to do. Super easy to set up and use. It really is a set up and let it work its magic kind of gem. I can't recomend this app enough.</p>
<hr><br>
<h3>Paperclip</h3>
<p>Paperclip makes it easy to deal with pictures in your app. Paperclip makes image uploads a breeze and even lets you set up sizing and thumbnails for images. This is an app that makes your life much, much easier.</p>
<hr><br>
<h3>CanCanCan</h3>
<p>CanCanCan is a gem that lets you authorize different levels of users for your site. Do you only want admins to delete posts? No problem. Only a posts creator can delete it's comments? Sure. That same user can't delete their post but they can edit it? Again, no problem. CanCanCan makes all of these authorizations easy. This is a great gem to use with Devise but I found it was a bit harder to set up than some of the other ones.</p>
<br><br>
<p>These are just some of the gems that I use with my Rails programs and they were all taught through the learn program. I have been branching out and trying to find new gems but these are the ones that keep coming back and being used over and over.</p>
