<p>I finished my development bootcamp curriculum recently, and I have been working on getting everything figured out in regards to landing a job. My career councelor did a mock cultural interview and, honestly, I don't know if I could have done much better. On completing the interview I was told I would be doing a mock technical interview later that week. This, I knew, was a weak point for me. On the spot coding and directly technical questions stress me out. Here is a walkthrough of what happened in the interview, what I learned from the experience, and what I will do to better prepare myself for my a real technical interview.</p>
<hr><br>

<h3>Before the interview</h3>
<p>Before the interview, I started studying my learn curriculum focused on technical interviews. The information here was, I believe, intentionally vague. I feel this way because the interview can go so many ways. I studied the material that was there, looked at some typical interview test questions that were provided and from other sources, and watched some youtube videos of people whiteboarding and writing code for interviews.</p>

<h3>The interview</h3>
<p>These are the tasks that I did not have to do in my interview that would probably happen in a real life interview:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The course mentioned whiteboarding, which I didn't have to do probably from the limitations of the website they used.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coding challenges before or after the interview, again something I didn't have to do because this was a one shot deal where I interviewed and will never hear from my interviewer again
  </li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly here are the tasks that I did have to do in my interview:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Specific test questions about languages I have used. The interviewer asked me what languages I have used and I mentioned mostly Ruby using Rails and more recently AngularJS.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer coding challenge using a website where both people could write code on a shared site. I was given a simple JavaScript sample to write.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During the question section, he asked me 5 or 6 questions about Ruby which I knew a few answers to but I was stumped about an equal amount. Some of the questions I knew how I could implement but I was not confident on why it worked or what it fully did. The interviewer helped me through some of these questions giving hints but I feel it would not be this way as much in an actual interview. He then switched to Angular questions and asked 8 or 9 questions about Angular.I honestly bombed most of these questions. I am not great at Angular and some of the questions he asked were about things I had never even heard about. When I told him that I had no idea what he was referring to he explained the answer to me and I wrote down notes to look at later. Overall this section did not go great. I believe this part took about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The coding challenge was the toughest part of the mock interview by far. The piece of code that he asked me to write was something that would have been easy if I was working at my own pace with all the resources I normally have while writing code, but that wasn't the case for the interview. I stumbled along for a while explaining what I thought the code should do and how I could go about doing it. Then, I started writing code. I had a lot of trouble getting the ideas from my head into the code and it definitely showed. The interviewer gave me some hints and leading ideas to help me finish the program. Overall, I definitely bombed this part of the interview. I would not get a followup interview if this had been a real interview. This section took about 30 minutes but if I had worked it out correctly could have easily been done in 15 - 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>After the Interview</h3>

<p>Now that the mock interview is finished I can look back on it and learn from my mistakes and make my next interview better. I learned that I was not at all prepared for the type of questions that would be asked. I know how to write code for an app but I don't really know why that code works. I am going to need to study this a lot before I am ready for a real interview. Also, it has been so long since I have written more algorithm based code that I have forgotten even where to start. If he had asked to create a RESTful site I could have done that no problem but that is not the kind of coding challenge that happens in a technical interview.</p>

<p>The interviewer recommended using interviewcake.com for sample coding questions and I am starting that in the coming week. I will also be purchasing a technical interview book to help me better prepare for the next interview. After all is said and done, this has been a great learning experience and I now know more about how an interview will go. This takes a lot of pressure off of me and saves me from falling on my face going into an interview I am not prepared for!</p>
