<h1>Why Am I Learning Software Design?</h1>
<br><br>
<p>A little backstory, in High School I studied programming. It was basic to intermediate programming mostly but it was something that I enjoyed. I started University and realized I was interested in History more than programming so I switched majors. As we all know, History is not a field that has a lot of opportunity if you aren't interested in teaching or research so I had to change paths again.</p>
<br>
<p>My then girlfriend and I moved to South Korea after University to get out and see the world. We spent five years abroad and traveled to multiple countries but we eventually decided we needed to move back to America and get married.</p>
<br>
<p>Back in America we got married and started to look towards the future. I knew that I didn't want to teach, study History, or do any of the odd jobs I had done in the past. I thought back to my programming classes in High School and remembered how much I enjoyed them.</p>
<br>
<p>I have found Learn to be challenging but rewarding so far. I am still going through the process but I am almost done. Looking back on my programs from the beginning of the program to the ones I am working on now are night and day, and I think show how much I have learned so far!</p>
