<h3>Planning:</h3><hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this assignment we had to create a CRUD application. It was supposed to track something important to me. I am a big fan of board games so this was the perfect fit for me. You can see the finished program here: <a href="https://github.com/pickledyamsman/game_organizer">Game Organizer</a>

<br>
<h3>How it works:</h3><hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program allows the user to log in or create a new user. After logging in the user can create a new board game that has a name, number of players, and manufacturer. After creating the game they are able to edit or delete any of the games.The user can then log out of game organizer.

<br>
<h3>Problems:</h3><hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the program relies off of previous programs done in the course but some parts of the program presented some challenges. I had a major problem where when I was editing a game only some of the parameters would update. This was a problem with the paths I was using and was cleaned up to allow it to properly edit.

<h3>Example:</h3><hr>
Here is a video of the program in action!
