<h3>My First Professional Interview</h3>

<p>I have been applying for a lot of positions lately and I got a call back for the job that I feel I am the most qualified for. The position is at a local school and uses skills that are in line with what I already know.</p>

<h3>Prep</h3>
<p>Before the interview, I needed to do some research. I looked up as much information about the company as I could and took a bunch of notes about it. I then researched the people that would be interviewing me. There was hardly any information which told me they had probably been in their positions for quite some time. I usually program on my desktop but my laptop is set up with all of my development needs. I was going to bring my laptop so I got any program I might want to show in the interview up and working.</p>

<h3>Interview Day: Pre-interview</h3>

<p>I had been nervous before the interview, but I had a plan for how to best prepare based on the learn career prep track. I dressed professionally for the interview because that is what I imagined the interviewers would be expecting, and I think that was definitely the right decision. For the interview, I brought five copies of my resume in case someone didn't have one (everyone did), my laptop with the charging cable for it, and a small moleskin notebook to take notes with. I arrived at the building the interview would be in about twenty minutes early and waited in the reception area until ten minutes before the interview. I waited inside because it is very hot in Athens this time of year. At ten minutes before the interview, I told them I was there and ready for the interview.</p>

<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p>The interview was a mix of standard, cultural, and technical. I was told before the interview that it would be this way through email. The interviewers had a list of preprepared questions that they rotated asking. For the most part, I was able to answer everything they threw at me but there were a few questions I had no idea what the answer was and I was honest about that. They asked me to describe one of my programs and I asked if I could show them the program on my laptop. They liked this and it really helped me show what I could do and how I worked around a program. This is definitely something I will prepare to do for interviews after this. I had researched the languages and technology the company used before the interview so when I was asked questions about them I was prepared to the best of my knowledge. Some of the technologies I had never worked with but I was able to show relevant experience with similar tech. I wasn't sure if they would want me to do any coding challenges or white boarding but I was somewhat prepared if they had asked. They didn't ask but from what they told me the role would be more maintenance than writing new code so it doesn't seem like they would need a coding challenge.</p>

<h3>After the interview</h3>
<p>Overall, I think the interview went really well. I left the interview confident that at least they would consider me for the job and I am expecting the hear back from them soon. That night I got my thoughts in order so that I could better send them follow-up emails the next day. The next morning I made a pot of coffee and in twenty or thirty minutes drafted all of the emails to send out and sent them within ten minutes of each other. I heard back quickly from one of the interviewers, and, now, I am waiting to hear back from the other three and see what the next step in the interview process might be. This was definitely a great learning experience, and it has helped me be better prepared for any interviews in the future.</p>
