<p>During the learn course there was a mention of a plugin for Sublime called Emmet. Emmet lets you type a short version of a command and it fills in the rest. As an example if you type in html and hit tab Emmet will fill in a basic HTML template for you.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to find out some other plugins that might help with my productivity so I searched around and here are a few I found that interest me. I am not sure about other text editors these will work with because I only use Sublime, but I am sure there are comparable plugins out there for your text editor!</p>

<h3>1. Package Controller</h3>
<p>During the installation of Emmet they had me use package controller. This is just a plugin to help you install other plugins. I have read that it makes everythign much easier but honestly I have only ever used this so I can't speak from experience with other installation methods.</p>

<h3>2. AllAutocomplete</h3>
<p>This plugin uses all of your open tabs to autocomplete. Sublime by default only uses the current tab but with this you are able to autocomplete a function in anoter tab. This is really useful especially when you get into JavaScript or Angular where you have lots of different files.</p>

<h3>3. ColorPicker</h3>
<p>ColorPicker gives you a built in color picker in Sublime. I don't use any photo editing software so I am not that great with colors. ColorPicker lets me pull it up and play around with colors so I know what to use. It gives you the color in hex just to make it even easier.</p>

<h3>4. DocBlockr</h3>
<p>I have been playing around with RubyMine for a few days on a friend's recommendation. In RubyMine it sets up comments in your code to show what everything does correctly. From what I understand it is the best practice. DocBlockr also sets up these kinds of comments. I haven't used it yet but I am interested in trying it out soon.</p>

<p>These are the plugins I am using and looking forward to trying out soon. Hopefully you will find something new in this list!</p>
