<p>I have been researching and applying to jobs like crazy for the past couple of weeks. While looking at these jobs I have been fairly confident that anything they threw at me I would be able to handle. I can learn new languages and frameworks especially if they are not that different from what I already know, I can work remotely if need be, I can even deal with the interview. What I have seen that really surprised me was how many companies want someone that is at least a little experienced with Linux.</p>

<p>I have never used Linux so this was something I knew I needed to fix. Two years ago I bought my first apple computer. I had one as a child but I don't think using that compares to what is out now. I bought that macbook so I could learn how they operate and get used to it. I knew I would eventually be using one whenever I learned how to program so I figured why wait. I realized they are really not that different than Windows computers but I stuck with it because I found I like apple products better.</p>

<p>I decided my big goal for the week was to turn my desktop hackintosh computer into a windows 10/Ubuntu dual boot system. This would give me all the operating system options I could ever want because I still have that macbook and can easily hook it up to my monitor.</p>

<p>My first hurdle was figuring out the distro I wanted to use. Unfortunately everyone has an opinion on which one to start with and why. After hours of research I settled with Ubuntu due to it having the smallest learning curve and easy installation.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, installing the dual boot setup took less than an hour and there were no problems along the way at all. First I installed Windows 10 and then Ubuntu and Ubuntu took care of everything involved in setting up the dual boot. It really couldn't have been easier.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew I would need was to get Rails up and running. I found an excellent guide at <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04">Go Rails</a> that took me through the full setup and got everything up and running smoothly.</p>

<p>The next step was getting my text editor up so I could write some code. I had been using Sublime Text but I figured I would try out what Linux had natively so I downloaded Kate. I found out right away that I hated it. It seems old habits die hard. Luckily it was really easy to download and set up Sublime Text so it would work exactly like I was used to.</p>

<p>I plan to really only use Ubuntu for coding so I only had small things to fix after that like getting my browser how I like it and messing with some settings. Overall, the whole setup took less than 2 hours including installation.</p>

<p>The main problem I am having is moving around the terminal. In OSX I had my code on a second hard drive that I just moved into and everything worked fine, but on Linux I haven't found a reliable way to get to the second drive. I can use the explorer to go to the folder I want and open a terminal there. This is a great feature but not really what I was hoping to do. I'm sure there is a way I just need to play around more.</p>

<p>Is it worth is? So far, I haven't done anything radically different from what I could on OSX. Maybe this is because they are both UNIX systems or maybe I just haven't done enough with it yet. I guess I will have to just keep experimenting.</p>
