<p>I have seen in multiple places that people get you a job. Taking that advice I decided I was going to go to a developer meet up in my area. I used the site meetup.com since it is pretty active in my city and they just so happen to have a developer's meet up once a month.</p>

<p>The developer's meet up was at a local taco place that I hadn't been to before, so this was an even bigger motivation to get out of the house and meet some local developers.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the meet up I was greeted almost immediately by some of the local developers and was asked some questions to make small talk. They asked what language I used, was I working freelance or did I work for a company, and what kind of projects I was working on. I haven't talked in person about writing code with many people so this meet up was a new experience to see if talking about my programs made any sense in practice.</p>

<p>It seemed that most of the people at the meet up had known each other for a long time, but everyone was really friendly and it never felt like they were trying to exclude anyone. There were two other guys there that this was their first meet up, and these were the two people that I talked to the most even though it might not have been the best move as someone looking for a job.</p>

<p>All in all, I met around 8 new people in my city that are involved in web development, either through front-end, back-end or some other form of development. After the meet up I added these new connections on LinkedIn and I have heard back from most of them.</p>

<p>It definitely seems like this was a successful meet up!</p>
